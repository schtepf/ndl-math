%%% You can change pre-defined colours here, override built-in macros from the
%%% style definition and standard library, as well as define macros needed by
%%% all local documents.

%%% e.g. adjust counterpoint (dark green) for data projectors where greens are
%%% far too bright, as well as green component of light colour and pure green
%%% (of course, it's a better solution to adjust the gamma settings of your monitor)

%% \definecolor{counterpoint}{rgb}{.1, .3, 0}
%% \definecolor{light}{rgb}{.45, .3, .55}
%% \definecolor{puregreen}{rgb}{0, .35, 0}

%% parenthesized superscript (time step / event token)
