  \begin{itemize}
  \item<2-> How many training steps are needed for a stochastic NDL learner to
    converge to the Danks equilibrium?
  \item<3-> Are there cases of non-convergence? If yes, why?
  \item<4-> Does NDL accuracy always improve with more cues and more training data?
      If not, why?
  \item<5-> How does logistic regression behave as incremental learner?
  \item<6-> Which sequences / patterns in the input data lead to significantly
    different behaviour from stochastic learner?
  \end{itemize}
